# HFS-Interpretability
Reproducible R implementation of Hierarchical Fuzzy Systems with dual-layer interpretability (Hmean, SHAP, LIME) for clinical risk prediction.

This repository provides the full reproducible R implementation for the paper:

> **Hierarchical Fuzzy Systems with Unified Structural and Post-hoc Interpretability: An R-Based Framework for Clinical Risk Prediction**  
> Tajul Rosli Razak
> Submitted to *Information Sciences*.

The repository contains:
- The complete Hierarchical Fuzzy Systems (HFS) framework,
- Implementations of both Parallel and Serial HFS topologies,
- Five medical case studies:
  - Heart disease
  - Diabetes
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Liver disorders
  - Breast cancer
- Structural interpretability evaluation (Hmean),
- Post-hoc explainability using SHAP and LIME,
- Scripts to reproduce all experiments reported in the paper.
